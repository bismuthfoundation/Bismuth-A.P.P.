# APP-0003

A cross app NFT tokens right management

## Why?

APP-0002 Allows for generic NFT to be deployed and transfered.

Some NFT could be used by several apps or game, but this lead to many concerns:
- who can I trust?
- who can create a NFT 
- What kind of NFT can my game support/allow (avoid too powerful weapons for instance)

This protocol provides an answer in the form of an abstract and decentralized register where NFT creators can register their tokens, and dApps owners decide which one they accept in their app, and what they do.
