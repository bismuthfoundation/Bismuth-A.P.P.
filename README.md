# Bismuth-A.P.P.
Bismuth Abstract Protocol Proposals

## Bismuth Abstract transactions

Bismuth Crypto-currency http://bismuth.cz does suppport arbitrary abstract transactions thanks to its exclusive "operation" and "data" meta fields.

You can read more at https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Hack-with-BIS/tree/master/01-Concepts

With such fields, we can then build protocols on top of the chain, without the need for any change in the running nodes, without requiring any specific processing from the nodes. It's just abstract data to them.

## Current Protocols
Some protocols already are running on top iof Bismuth, see https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Hack-with-BIS/tree/master/01-Concepts/protocols

Bismuth native token support, Alias registration, Dragginator, Autogame... all are live examples of Abstract protocols.

We call them "Abstract" protocols, because all depends on how the data is interpreted, who is considered as the source of trusted data provider, and these protocols could as well run on any chain that supports some arbitrary data field.

## Abstract Protocol Proposals

This repository's goal is to gather new protocols specifications, discuss and fine tune them, and finally link to their implementations(s)
