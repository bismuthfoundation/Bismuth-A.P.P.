Bismuth Abstract Protocol Proposals

## Bismuth Abstract transactions

Bismuth Crypto-currency http://bismuth.cz does suppport arbitrary abstract transactions thanks to its exclusive "operation" and "data" meta fields, both of which are UTF8 text strings.

You can read more at https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Hack-with-BIS/tree/master/01-Concepts

With such fields, we can then build protocols on top of the chain, without the need for any change in the running nodes, without requiring any specific processing from the nodes. It's just abstract data to them.

## Current Protocols
Some protocols already are running on top of Bismuth, see https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Hack-with-BIS/tree/master/01-Concepts/protocols

Bismuth native token support, Alias registration, Dragginator, Autogame... all are live examples of Abstract protocols.

We call them "Abstract" protocols, because all depends on how the data is interpreted, who is considered as the source of trusted data provider, and these protocols could as well run on any chain that supports some arbitrary data field.

Whereas ERC standards are defined by smart contract interfaces, Abstract protocols are defined by abstract transactions and their meaning. The protocols are completely implementation agnostic.

## Abstract Protocol Proposals

This repository's goal is to gather new protocols specifications, discuss and fine tune them, and finally link to their implementation(s).
